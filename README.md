# Rust Backend Boilerplate üç≥
A robust and scalable backend boilerplate built with Rust and Axum, designed to kickstart your next project with best practices in mind.

## Features
- **Axum**: A lightweight, fast, and ergonomic web framework for Rust.
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **OpenAPI**: Automatically generated API documentation for seamless integration.
- **ORM**: Database abstraction for simplified and type-safe querying.
- **Authentication**: Secure your routes using JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) for robust authentication.
